## Mission objectives

- Use of computer vision techniques for tracking poses on images and videos.
- Exploration of pre-trained models for pose tracking on live and streaming media.
- Deployment of models for end-customers.

## The Mission

The client is a wellbeing company based in NY city. They are currently providing yoga sessions online with trainers connected in real-time. This system allows the company to reach more people, facilitates the agenda of the clients, and increases the engagement on the sessions since the coaches are available to help.

Now, the job is becoming challenging for the coaches because it's hard for them to keep track of the progress of each one of the participants. They would like to evaluate if the people are doing correctly the poses and provide custom-made training plans but it's hard to do when hundreds are joining the same class.

Would you like to travel to NY? The company is asking for an AI developer with the skills to build an application able to track the poses done by the yoga practitioner, measure time, repetitions and evaluate if the poses are done correctly.

The company envisions an MVP where the customers receive a report of the yoga poses, which ones were done correctly, and metrics related to time and repetition.
